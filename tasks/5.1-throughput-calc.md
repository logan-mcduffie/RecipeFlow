# Task 5.1: Throughput Calculator

**Phase**: 5 - GregTech Calculations
**Status**: Not Started

## Summary

Calculate items/fluids per time unit based on machine configuration.

## Why This Matters

Core GregTech feature - understanding production rates is essential for designing efficient processing chains.

## Inputs/Outputs

- **Input**: Recipe, machine tier, parallel count
- **Output**: Items/fluids per second/minute/hour

## Technical Notes

**Base calculation**:
```
throughput = output_quantity / recipe_duration_seconds
```

**Overclock formula** (standard GT):
- Each tier above recipe tier: 4x EU cost, 2x speed
- Example: LV recipe (32 EU/t, 10s) run on MV:
  - EU/t: 32 × 4 = 128 EU/t
  - Duration: 10s ÷ 2 = 5s
  - Throughput: 2x base

**Parallel multiplier**:
```
effective_throughput = base_throughput × parallel_count
```

**Display options**:
- Items per second
- Items per minute
- Items per hour
- Fluids in L/s, L/min, L/hour

**Handle complex recipes**:
- Multiple outputs (show each)
- Chance-based outputs (show expected value)
- Fluid + item outputs together

## Files to Touch

- `packages/web/src/calculator/throughput.ts`
- `packages/web/src/calculator/overclock.ts`
- `packages/web/src/editor/panels/ThroughputPanel.tsx`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Base throughput calculated correctly
- [ ] Overclocking adjusts speed properly (2x per tier)
- [ ] Parallel machines multiply throughput
- [ ] Time unit conversion works (sec/min/hour)
- [ ] Displays both fluids and items
- [ ] Handles chance-based outputs
- [ ] Shows power consumption at each tier
