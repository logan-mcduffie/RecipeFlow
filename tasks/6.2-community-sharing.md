# Task 6.2: Community Sharing

**Phase**: 6 - Flowchart Persistence & Sharing
**Status**: Not Started

## Summary

Publish flowcharts to modpack's public gallery.

## Why This Matters

Core community feature - share knowledge and discoveries with other players.

## Inputs/Outputs

- **Input**: Private flowchart
- **Output**: Publicly visible flowchart in modpack gallery

## Technical Notes

**Publish flow**:
1. User clicks "Publish" on their flowchart
2. Confirm dialog with options:
   - Title (required)
   - Description (optional)
   - Tags (e.g., "circuits", "early-game", "power")
3. Flowchart marked as public
4. Appears in modpack's community gallery

**Gallery features**:
- Browse by modpack, then by version
- Filter by tags
- Search by name or items used
- Sort: Recent, Popular, Most Starred
- Pagination

**Viewing public flowcharts**:
- Read-only view
- Can zoom/pan but not edit
- Shows author, date, stars
- "Fork" button to copy to your own flowcharts

**Fork functionality**:
- Creates personal copy
- Links back to original (attribution)
- User can then edit their copy

**Popularity system**:
- Star/favorite flowcharts
- Star count shown on cards
- "My Starred" view for user
